Category,Threat,Mitigation,Priority,Implementation
Authentication Security,Unauthorized admin access,"• Strong password requirements (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
• Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) mandatory for Super Admin
• Session timeout after 30 min inactivity
• Login attempt rate limiting (5 attempts/15 min)
• IP whitelisting option for admin access",Critical,"JWT with refresh tokens, OTP via SMS/Email, Redis for rate limiting"
Authorization Security,Privilege escalation,"• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
• Principle of least privilege
• Granular permission checks on every API call
• Admin action requires confirmation for destructive operations
• No direct database access from admin UI",Critical,Middleware checking user.role and permissions array
Audit & Accountability,Untraceable malicious actions,"• Log every admin action with timestamp, IP, user agent
• Immutable audit logs (append-only)
• Before/after values for all modifications
• Real-time alerts for critical actions (mass delete, payment changes)
• Weekly audit log reviews",Critical,"Middleware logging to audit_logs collection, webhook alerts"
Data Protection,Sensitive data exposure,"• Mask sensitive fields (phone, email) in user lists
• Full data only visible on detail view with permission
• Encrypt backups with AES-256
• No export of passwords (even hashed)
• Anonymize data for exports when possible",High,"Field-level masking in API responses, backup encryption"
Input Validation,"SQL injection, XSS attacks","• Validate all admin inputs server-side
• Parameterized queries (MongoDB safe by default)
• Sanitize rich text editor content
• File upload validation (type, size, malware scan)
• Content Security Policy headers",High,"Joi/Yup validation schemas, DOMPurify for HTML, ClamAV for files"
Session Management,Session hijacking,"• Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
• Rotate session tokens after privilege actions
• Logout on password change
• Concurrent session limits (1 active session)
• Session binding to IP address",High,"JWT stored in httpOnly cookies, Redis session store"
Backup Security,Data loss or unauthorized access,"• Encrypted backups (AES-256)
• Access controls on backup storage (S3 bucket policies)
• Regular restore testing (monthly)
• Versioning enabled on backup storage
• Geographic redundancy (multi-region)",High,"AWS S3 encryption, IAM roles, versioning enabled"
Communication Security,Credential exposure in emails/WhatsApp,"• Never send passwords via email/WhatsApp
• Use secure password reset links (time-limited, single-use)
• Encrypt email templates containing sensitive data
• Rate limit communication APIs
• Validate recipient before sending",Medium,"Token-based password reset, E2E encryption for sensitive comms"
Monitoring & Alerts,Delayed breach detection,"• Real-time monitoring of admin actions
• Anomaly detection (unusual hours, locations, actions)
• Failed login alerts after 3 attempts
• Database query monitoring
• Uptime monitoring with alerts",Medium,"Sentry for errors, custom webhooks for admin alerts, UptimeRobot"
Third-Party Security,Compromised dependencies,"• Regular npm audit and updates
• Use only trusted packages
• Lock dependency versions
• HTTPS for all external API calls
• API key rotation policy (quarterly)",Medium,"Dependabot, package-lock.json, environment variables for keys"
